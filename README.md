# Avas-Core

##Ava's Core Index - coded by Lunaversity
##"da super responsive designed multi-function index page"

I created this to counter the over-priced downloadable script "Exit Core" it is $20 for 1 index page that just has scrollbars disabled.
Of course it doesn't look 100% the same cause I didn't want to put too much effort into it but it's a nice alternative.

#Credits:
